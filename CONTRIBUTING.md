# Branching & Push Policy

- main is the primary development branch. All feature branches and PRs should target `main`.
- master is the deployment branch and must NOT be pushed to without explicit permission from the repository owner.
- Do NOT push directly to `master`. If you need to deploy or make a release, coordinate with the repository owner and get explicit approval.

This rule is intentionally strict to avoid accidental deployments. Treat `master` as protected.

Thanks for following the policy.
