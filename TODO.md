IMPORTANT NOTE: Branch policy

- main is the primary development branch. Do not push to `master` unless explicitly instructed by the repository owner.

4. Home button & header polish (added 2025-09-29)

- Scope: Polish the home route (`/`) by applying consistent border styling to the call-to-action buttons, updating the 'To Dashboard' icon to be thematically accurate, and showing the user's Google profile image in the header when available.
- Files to update: `src/app/page.tsx` (home), `src/components/Header.tsx` or wherever the logged-in user display is rendered, and any small helper components for the home CTA (e.g., `src/components/HomeButton.tsx` if present). Also update tests for home route render.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - The 'To Dashboard', 'Sign in', and 'Sign out' buttons on `/` include `border-2 border-base-content` (or `border-on` combined with `border-base-content` where appropriate) so they visually match other bordered controls.
  - The 'To Dashboard' CTA uses a more semantically appropriate icon (suggestion: `Home`, `Grid`, or `ArrowRightSquare` from `lucide-react`) and the icon aligns correctly with button text.
  - If the user is logged in via Google, the header shows the Google profile image avatar (from OAuth profile data). If no image is available, show a fallback avatar with initials.
  - Unit/visual tests updated: ensure home CTA buttons render with the new border classes and header shows profile image when present.

## ðŸ“Œ New Project Modal Updates

8. Dashboard â€” New Project modal: optional project-only flow

- Scope: Update the Dashboard New Project flow (currently implemented in `TaskModal.tsx` / Dashboard modal wiring) so that creating a new project can optionally be done without simultaneously creating a task. The modal should expose a toggle (or choose the flow via separate "Create only project" button) that will only create the Project when selected and skip task creation. This helps users who want to add project containers without an immediate starter task.
- Files to update: `src/components/TaskModal.tsx` (split or add option), `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/lib/api.ts` (ensure `POST /api/projects` handles a project-only payload), and any client stores that expect both objects to be created together (e.g., `projectStore.ts`, `taskStore.ts`). If the combined creation flow remains supported, ensure the client performs the createProject -> createTask flow atomically (server-side transaction preferred).
- Acceptance criteria:
  - The New Project modal includes a clear option to create a project without creating a task (toggle or distinct UI path).
  - When the project-only option is selected, the client sends a `POST /api/projects` call and does NOT create a task; the new project appears in the sidebar and `/projects` view immediately after creation.
  - The combined (project + task) flow still works unchanged when the user chooses it; tasks created with a new project are correctly linked to the new project's id.
  - Unit tests added for modal behavior and an API test for project-only creation.
  - Documentation and `implementation.md` updated to reflect the change.

# Immediate TODO (curate me)

NOTE: Development process â€” prioritize UI/UX work first, then backend production features, then polish/maintenance. Keep `TODO.md` current: review and update it on every commit/push and move completed items into `implementation.md`'s "Completed tasks" section. This policy is enforced by the team and documented in `implementation.md`.

This file contains a prioritized, actionable set of next tasks based on the current implementation notes in `implementation.md` and `project_stack.md`. Curate and reorder as you like â€” each item is intentionally scoped small so we can work in short PRs.

## High priority

These are the immediate actionable items. Completed items were moved to `implementation.md` under "Completed tasks".

- [ ] TaskCard redesign with DaisyUI styling

  - Scope: Overhaul `src/components/TaskCard.tsx` layout to use modern DaisyUI-inspired sections while preserving all current behaviors (status cycling, edit/delete, expand, keyboard support).
  - Acceptance criteria: (1) Card adopts cohesive DaisyUI color palette and spacing without regressions to interactions; (2) All controls remain accessible with focus states and tooltips intact; (3) Existing tests continue to pass; (4) Visual polish documented with before/after notes in `implementation.md`.

- [ ] Fix the dailies view to reset daily

  - Ensure the Dailies view resets correctly once per day for users. Files to check: `src/app/dailies/page.tsx`, `src/components/DailiesClient.tsx`, `src/lib/utils.ts` (or where date logic lives), and `src/lib/taskStore.ts` / `src/lib/projectStore.ts` if dailies are persisted in state or DB. Acceptance criteria: (1) Dailies reset at local midnight (or configurable timezone) and UI reflects the reset without requiring a full page reload; (2) Completed/checked dailies are archived or cleared per current product spec; (3) Unit/integration tests cover reset logic and edge cases (timezone differences, daylight savings, offline/online reconnection). Implementation notes: compute next reset timestamp and schedule a client-side timer or revalidate on focus; if using server-side persisted streaks, add a last-seen date check and reset on fetch. Include test helpers to mock Date/time and tests for reset behavior.

- [ ] The dailies list should cap out at around 8 items and warn users when they try to create more with a tooltip on a disabled '+ Add Daily' button

  - Limit the visible/creatable dailies to ~8 items and show a user-facing tooltip when the '+ Add Daily' button is disabled. Files to change: `src/components/DailiesClient.tsx`, `src/components/TaskModal.tsx` or the component that renders the Add button, and `src/styles/` (tooltip styles). Acceptance criteria: (1) Users cannot create more than the configured hard cap (default to 8); (2) The '+ Add Daily' button becomes disabled at the cap and displays a tooltip on hover explaining why (e.g., 'Daily limit reached â€” archive or delete an existing daily to add a new one'); (3) Accessible behavior: tooltip readable by screen readers and keyboard focus. Implementation notes: enforce limit in both UI and API (if creation is server-backed) and write RTL tests that assert the button is disabled and the tooltip text appears.

- [ ] Fix the timer UI

  - Repair and polish the Timer UI to be consistent, responsive, and accessible. Files to check: `src/components/TimerWidget.tsx`, `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` (if it is used there), and global CSS / `tailwind.config.cjs`. Acceptance criteria: (1) Timer shows start/pause/reset controls and remaining time; (2) Visual states and animations don't shift layout unexpectedly; (3) Keyboard controls and ARIA attributes are present; (4) Timer integrates with dailies if a daily has an associated timer. Implementation notes: add tests for control behavior, simulate time progression in tests, and handle edge cases like background/visibility changes and system sleep.

- [ ] Enable handling some settings regarding the dailies (e.g. max number of dailies (5-10), whether the timer should show by default, etc)

- [ ] Dashboard: New Project modal should accept a description

  - When a user creates a project from the Dashboard 'New Project' modal, the modal must include a multiline "Description" field. Files to update: `src/components/TaskModal.tsx` (or wherever the Dashboard new-project modal lives), `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`, and `src/lib/api.ts` to accept and forward a description on create. Acceptance criteria: (1) The modal shows a labeled Description input (textarea); (2) Description is sent to the backend `POST /api/projects` call and persisted on the Project model; (3) The newly created project's description is visible on the project details page and editable later; (4) Unit tests validate the create flow and the API payload; (5) Accessible labels and autofocus behavior for the project name input remain intact.

  - Add user settings to configure dailies behavior: max number of dailies (range 5-10), whether the timer shows by default, and optionally daily reset timezone behavior. Files to update/add: `src/app/settings/page.tsx`, `src/components/Settings/` (create if needed), `src/lib/themeStore.ts` or create a new `src/lib/dailiesStore.ts` for persistence, and `src/lib/api.ts` if settings are persisted to backend. Acceptance criteria: (1) Settings UI accessible from `Settings` page; (2) Changes persist to local state or backend and immediately affect Dailies UI (e.g., changing max updates the Add button state); (3) Tests cover settings changes and persistence. Implementation notes: validate numeric ranges (5-10) and update TODO for server-side storage if we decide to persist settings in the DB.

## Medium priority

- [ ] Server-side validation & DB constraints

  - Enforce unique project names (case-insensitive) if appropriate
  - Return user-friendly errors for duplicates

- [ ] Add tests for project creation

  - Unit tests for the projects router (Vitest)
  - E2E test for the modal flow (Playwright or Testing Library + jsdom)

- [ ] UI polish and accessibility

  - Autofocus New Project input when opening the modal via New Project
  - Add proper `aria-*` attributes and keyboard handling

- [ ] Auto-link tasks created together with a new project

  - If a user creates a new task at the same time they're creating a new project (for example, via the Dashboard flow where the New Project modal also creates a starter task), the task should be created and assigned to the newly created project in a single atomic flow. Implementation notes: (1) Client should POST to a combined endpoint or perform a server-side transaction that creates the Project then creates any Task(s) referencing the new project's id; (2) If using separate calls, ensure the client waits for the Project create response and uses its id when creating the Task(s); (3) Rollback semantics or error handling: if task creation fails after project creation, surface an error and allow retry or cleanup; (4) Files to inspect/update: `src/components/TaskModal.tsx`, `src/lib/api.ts`, `src/pages/api/projects/route.ts` (or `src/app/api/projects/route.ts`), and `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`. Acceptance criteria: newly-created tasks appear under the project immediately; no orphan tasks are left in the default project/state when the combined flow is used; tests validate the combined creation flow and error cases.

## Low / future

# Project priorities

Replace this file with the following prioritized tasks. Tackle them in order and update progress here.

1.  Hook deployed app to Render Postgres (high priority)

    - Ensure Vercel (frontend) and any server-side code can reach the Render Postgres instance.
    - Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly in the Vercel Environment (and Render service if applicable).
    - Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` against the Render DB to apply migrations.
    - Verify API routes (projects, tasks, activity) succeed on the deployed site.

2.  Fix Clerk production environment on deployed app (high priority)

    - Rotate Clerk keys if they were exposed; generate new keys in Clerk dashboard.
    - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` to Vercel (and Render) environment settings.
    - Configure allowed origins and redirect URLs in Clerk for `https://zenite.life`.
    - Redeploy frontend after env vars are set and confirm Clerk logs show production keys.

3.  Improve home page UX when signed out (medium priority)

    - Replace the blank CTA for signed-out users with a visible `Get Started` button linking to `/signup`.
    - Reduce the vertical size of the second slide (HomeFeatures) to avoid excessive scrolling on small screens.

4.  Buttons and borders (medium priority)

    - Audit key call-to-action buttons and ensure they include `border-on` or `border-black` where appropriate.
    - Apply quick, low-risk fixes for important CTAs; record remaining stylistic work for manual polish.

5.  Activity tracker behavior (low/medium priority)

    - Hidden by default for new visitors (do not auto-open the tracker unless the user previously opened it).
    - Add a toggle in Settings to opt-in to showing the activity tracker by default.

6.  Visual depth and layering (low priority)
    - Add subtle background layers using `bg-base-100`, `bg-base-200`, `bg-base-300` in main layout and major panels to create depth.
    - Avoid heavy changes; prefer small incremental steps and document any design choices.

Notes

- After fixing production env issues (DB and Clerk), validate flows on `https://zenite.life` with an incognito window.
- If secrets were committed to `master`, rotate them immediately and consider removing them from git history later.

When a task is done, update this file with a short status line and date.

- [ ] Restore Projects/Settings sidebar gap
