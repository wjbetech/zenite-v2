# User Authentication & Data Isolation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive user-scoped data access control to ensure users can only see and manage their own tasks and projects.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File: `prisma/schema.prisma`**
- Added `ownerId` field to `Project` model (required, indexed)
- Added `owner` relation to `User` via `ProjectOwner` relation
- Added `ownedProjects` relation array to `User` model

**Migration: `20251010061320_add_owner_to_projects`**
- Applied to production database successfully
- All new projects require an ownerId

### 2. Authentication Infrastructure
**File: `src/lib/auth.ts`**
- Enhanced NextAuth callbacks to include user ID in JWT token and session
- User ID is now accessible via `session.user.id` in addition to email

**File: `src/lib/auth-helpers.ts`** *(NEW)*
- `getAuthUserId()`: Returns authenticated user ID or creates/returns demo user for local dev
- `requireAuth()`: Strict authentication check that returns 401 if no valid session

### 3. API Route Security

#### Tasks API (`src/app/api/tasks/route.ts`)
- ✅ **GET**: Filters tasks by authenticated user only
- ✅ **POST**: Always assigns tasks to authenticated user (ignores any provided ownerId)
- ✅ **PATCH**: Verifies ownership before update (403 Forbidden if not owner)
- ✅ **DELETE**: Verifies ownership before deletion (403 Forbidden if not owner)

#### Projects API (`src/app/api/projects/route.ts`)
- ✅ **GET**: Filters projects by authenticated user only
- ✅ **POST**: Always assigns projects to authenticated user
- ✅ **PATCH**: Verifies ownership before update (403 Forbidden if not owner)
- ✅ **DELETE**: Verifies ownership before deletion (403 Forbidden if not owner)

#### Project Tasks API (`src/app/api/projects/[id]/tasks/route.ts`)
- ✅ **GET**: Returns tasks only for the specified project (inherits user filter from parent project check)

#### Project Detail API (`src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`)
- ✅ **GET**: Verifies project ownership before returning details (403 Forbidden if not owner)
- ✅ **DELETE**: Verifies ownership before deletion (403 Forbidden if not owner)

#### Activity API (`src/app/api/activity/route.ts`)
- ✅ **GET**: Filters activity entries by authenticated user
- ✅ **POST**: Assigns activity entries to authenticated user

#### Profile Counts API (`src/app/api/profile/counts/route.ts`)
- ✅ Counts only the authenticated user's tasks

### 4. Server Component Updates

#### Dashboard (`src/components/Dashboard.tsx`)
- Already filters tasks by user through API (no changes needed)

#### Dailies (`src/app/dailies/page.tsx`)
- Already filters tasks by user through API (no changes needed)

#### Projects List (`src/app/projects/page.tsx`)
- Already filters projects by user through API (no changes needed)

#### Project Detail (`src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Now queries with user filter
- Returns 403 Forbidden if user tries to access another user's project

## Security Guarantees

### ✅ Data Isolation
- **Tasks**: Each user can only see/modify their own tasks
- **Projects**: Each user can only see/modify their own projects
- **Activity**: Each user's activity heat map shows only their completions

### ✅ Authorization Checks
- All PATCH/DELETE operations verify ownership before proceeding
- Returns proper HTTP status codes:
  - `401 Unauthorized`: No valid session (strict auth only)
  - `403 Forbidden`: Valid session but not the owner
  - `404 Not Found`: Resource doesn't exist

### ✅ No Data Leakage
- API responses never include data from other users
- Project task lists are filtered at the query level
- Activity counts and charts are user-specific

## Local Development
For local development without authentication, the system automatically creates a demo user:
- Email: `local@zenite.dev` (configurable via `DEFAULT_TASK_OWNER_EMAIL`)
- Name: `Zenite Demo User` (configurable via `DEFAULT_TASK_OWNER_NAME`)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Multi-User Test**: Create two different authenticated sessions (different Google accounts) and verify:
   - User A cannot see User B's tasks or projects
   - User A cannot modify/delete User B's data
   - Each user's dashboard shows only their own data

2. **API Test**: Try to access another user's resource by ID:
   ```bash
   # Should return 403 Forbidden
   PATCH /api/tasks with id=<other-user-task-id>
   DELETE /api/projects?id=<other-user-project-id>
   ```

3. **Activity Heatmap**: Verify that each user's activity heatmap shows only their completed tasks

## Migration Notes
- Production database updated successfully
- Demo user created/verified: `local@zenite.dev`
- Database was empty at migration time (no data conflicts)

## Files Modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/lib/auth.ts`
- `src/lib/auth-helpers.ts` (NEW)
- `src/app/api/tasks/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/projects/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/tasks/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/activity/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/profile/counts/route.ts`
- `src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`

## Next Steps
1. Test with multiple user accounts
2. Consider adding user switching/impersonation for admin users (future)
3. Add audit logging for sensitive operations (future)
4. Consider soft deletes to preserve data history (future)
